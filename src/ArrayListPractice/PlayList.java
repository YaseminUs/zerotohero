    // Create a program that implements a playlist for songs.
    // Create one Song class having Title, Duration(as a minute) and Singer and Writer name for songs.
    // Create three argument constructor to initialize the instance variables of the Song class.

    // If it is not added to the playlist it will return false. To be able to add the song to the playlist
    // there are three condition which you need to check. If title of the song is avaliable inside the playlist,
    // or song number inside playlist is more than 5 or total duration of the songs inside playlist is more than 20 min
    // you can not add the song to the arraylist.
